# EmbeddedMasterPassword
An embedded implementation of the MasterPassword project


TL;DR
=====

This project provides Maarten Billemont's [Master Password](https://masterpassword.app/) algorithm to the embedded
world providing a physical manifestation of that algorithm in a small hardware device. My personal choice of hardware
is [Paul Stoffregen's](https://www.pjrc.com/) amazing Teensy 4.x devices.
